    <h2>Recent Projects</h2>
    <h3>Project 1: Data Visualization in Python</h3>
    <p>This project focused on data visualization in Python using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. I created a
      variety of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and box plots. I also created heatmaps and pair
      plots to explore relationships between variables in a dataset.</p>
    <h3>Project 2: Machine Learning in Python</h3>
    <p>This project focused on machine learning in Python using the Scikit-Learn library. I built and evaluated several
      machine learning models, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. I
      also used cross-validation and grid search to optimize model performance.</p>
    <h3>Project 3: Natural Language Processing in Python</h3>
    <p>This project focused on natural language processing in Python using the NLTK and TextBlob libraries. I performed
      text preprocessing, tokenization, and part-of-speech tagging. I also built a sentiment analysis model to classify
      text as positive, negative, or neutral.</p>
